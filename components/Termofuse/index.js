      <h1>Terms of Use Agreement</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to blitz-bot.com. blitz-bot.com is an online platform that
        allows individuals, companies, developers and agencies to easily build,
        host, and manage chatbots. Please read on to learn the rules and
        restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services
        and applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments,
        or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at
        contact@blitz-bot.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and
        blitz-bot.com. (“blitz-bot.com,” “we” and “us”). Your use of the
        Services is also governed by and subject to the Facebook Platform
        Policies (located at https://developers.facebook.com/policy) and
        Facebook Commerce Product Merchant Agreement (currently located here:
        https://www.facebook.com/legal/commerce_product_merchant_agreement),
        which are hereby incorporated by reference and are a part of these
        Terms. You are solely responsible and liable for complying with the
        Facebook Platform Policies and Facebook Commerce Product Merchant
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must agree to and accept all of the Terms, or you don’t have the
        right to use the Services. Your using the Services in any way means that
        you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect
        while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this
        document, as well as those in the{" "}
        <Link href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link>.
      </p>
      <h2>Will these Terms ever change?</h2>
      <p>
        We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may
        need to change along with the Services. We reserve the right to change
        the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention
        by placing a notice on the blitz-bot.com.com website, by sending you an
        email, and/or by some other means.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them;
        unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the
        Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms
        is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or
        modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and
        signed by both you and us.

      <h2>
        Do I have to grant any licenses to blitz-bot.com or to other users ?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through
        the Services, including any chatbots you create and/or communicate with
        through the Services, is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions
        are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions
        on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where
        applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions.
        Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our{" "}
        <a href="privacy_policy.html">
          <Link href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</Link>
        </a>{" "}
        to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your
        personally-identifiable information.
      </p>
      <p>
        For all User Submissions, you hereby grant blitz-bot.com a license to
        translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your
        content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce
        and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to
        enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below.
        This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not
        affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you store a User Submission in your own personal blitz-bot.com
        account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you
        (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant blitz-bot.com the license
        above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your
        Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal
        User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary
        to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain
        specified users can view (for example, a private message to a chatbot)(a
        “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant blitz-bot.com the
        licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute
        your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making
        that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified
        users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant
        such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience
        User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted
        by the functionality of the Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a
        manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or
        if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback,
        suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests
        relating to the Services (each of the foregoing, a “Public User
        Submission”), then you grant blitz-bot.com the licenses above, as well
        as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User
        Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission
        accessible to all blitz-bot.com users and providing the Services
        necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and
        exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with
        the Services for any purpose. Also, you grant all other users of the
        Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and
        exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the
        Services. You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free,
        perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using the free version of the Services, all your chatbots
        created through the Services will automatically include an attribution
        to blitz-bot.com. You agree not to remove, modify, or obscure the
        blitz-bot.com attribution. In addition, whether you are using the free
        or paid version of the Services, you hereby grant blitz-bot.com a
        nonexclusive license to use any chatbots you create using the Services
        in blitz-bot.com’s marketing materials (such as on blitz-bot.com.com).
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, you understand and agree that blitz-bot.com, in performing the
        required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including
        you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and
        adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection
        networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses
        include the rights to do so.

        harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third

      </p>
      <p>
        Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or
        through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or

        associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such

        disputes and/or our Services.
      </p>
      <h2>Will blitz-bot.com ever change the Services?</h2>
      <p>
        We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over
        time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may
        introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict
        access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice
        when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely
        affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the
        right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any
        reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you
        contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole
        discretion, and without notice.

        paid PRO Subscription version of the Services (PRO Plan). If you are
        using the paid PRO Subscription version of the Services, you agree to
        pay all applicable fees for such Services. blitz-bot.com reserves the
        right to charge for certain or all services in the future. We will

        applicable fees for such Services.

      <p>
        Account termination may result in destruction of any chatbots and
        Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you
        decide to terminate your account. We will try to provide advance notice
        to you prior to our terminating your account so that you are able to
        retrieve any important User Submissions you may have stored in your
        account (to the extent allowed by law and these Terms), but we may not
        do so if we determine it would be impractical, illegal, not in the
        interest of someone’s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the
        rights or property of blitz-bot.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these
        Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following
        will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify
        us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or
        intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.
