        following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By using or accessing
        the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the
        practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby
        consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the

      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that your use of blitz-bot.com’s Services is at all times
        subject to the <Link href="/term-of-use">Terms of Use</Link>, which
        incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy
        without defining them have the definitions given to them in the{" "}

      <h2>What does this Privacy Policy cover?</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable
        information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are
        accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies
        we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather
        various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in
        more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in
        connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and
        improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account, to enable
        you to build chatbots and communicate with chatbots others have built,
        to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your
        requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use
        the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal
        Information with third parties, but only as described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted in the <Link href="/term-of-use">Terms of Use</Link>, we do not
        knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the
        age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for
        the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If
        we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under
        age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you
        believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information,
        please contact us at contact@blitz-bot.com
      </p>
      <h2>Will blitz-bot.com ever change this Privacy Policy?</h2>
      <p>
        We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to
        change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert
        you to changes by placing a notice on blitz-bot.com.com, by sending you
        an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted
        not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us
        with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use
        of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and
        understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the
        Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the
        changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy
        Policy in effect at the time such information is used.
      </p>
      <h2>What Information does blitz-bot.com Collect?</h2>
      <h3>Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
      <p>
        We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For
        example, if you create an account on our Services to build a chatbot,
        through the registration process and/or through your account settings,
        we may collect Personal Information such as, but not limited to, your
        name, email address, timezone, list of Facebook Pages you own. Or, if
        you are an individual who communicates with chatbots that have been
        created using our services, we may collect information such as, but not
        limited to, your name, gender, time zone, and avatar/picture. If you
        provide your Facebook or other third-party account credentials to, you
        understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third
        Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with
        us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services
        is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, when you log in to our
        Services using your Facebook Messenger account, we may receive your
        personal information associated with that account, such as your Facebook
        pages. Certain information may be required to register with us or to
        take advantage of some of our features.
      </p>
      <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <p>
        Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and
        record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which
        may include any chatbots you have created using the Services, your
        conversation history with the chatbots(s), IP address, geolocation data,
        device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or
        device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you
        requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or
        device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how
        and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many
        people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or
        device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this
        may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third
        party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does
        not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t
        responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware
        that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your
        activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third
        parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your
        browser or device.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you
        might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve
        the Services or to help developers build better chatbots– for example,
        this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the
        Services, or what kinds of questions users ask of certain chatbots, and
        we can use that knowledge to make the Services and the chatbots created
        through the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
      </p>
      <h3>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect
        information about your online activity after you leave our Services.
        Just like any other usage information we collect, this information
        allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience,
        and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may
        offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to
        operators of websites and web applications and services (including
        behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to
        track certain of your online activities over time and across different
        websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this
        time.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Will blitz-bot.com Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?
      </h2>
      <p>
        We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally
        identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with
        third parties as described in this section:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Information that’s been de-identified.</b> We may de-identify your
        Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual,
        and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide
        aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to
        collect that information from you), who may use such information to
        understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that
        they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However,
        we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a
        partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner
        that would identify you as an individual person.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Chatbot Developers:</b> The developers/owners of chatbots created
        through the Services which you communicate with will have access to the
        Personal Information you provide to them. For example, if you
        communicate with a chatbot which was created through the Services, the
        developer/owner of that chatbot may have access to your conversation
        history with the chatbot, your username, your avatar, and any other
        information you provide through the chatbot. In addition, the chatbot
        developer/owner may use a third party product integration to receive and
        process the data from your interaction with the chatbot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Affiliated Businesses:</b> In certain situations, businesses or third
        party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or
        services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone
        or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is
        associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your
        Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent
        that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may
        include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party
        Account Information, such as your Facebook Messenger profile
        information, to your Services profile or to automatically transmit
        information in your Services profile to your third party account. We
        have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites
        or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take
        part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or
        business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Agents:</b> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on
        our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide
        products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment
        processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions
        for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right
        to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is
        necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a
        “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of
        the “Information that’s been de-identified” section in that regard.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Business Transfers:</b> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may
        share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the
        evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our
        assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or
        go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be
        one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Protection of blitz-bot.com and Others:</b> We reserve the right to
        access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is
        necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our{" "}
        <Link href="/term-of-use">Terms of Use</Link> and other agreements; or
        protect the rights, property, or safety of blitz-bot.com, our employees,
        our users, or others.
      </p>
      <h2>Is Personal Information about me secure?</h2>
      <p>
        Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.
        If you access your account via Facebook or another third party site or
        service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via
        that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access
        to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting
        your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting
        access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you
        have finished accessing your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal
        Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot
        guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or
        software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user
        information at any time.
      </p>
      <h2>What choices do I have?</h2>
      <p>
        You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind
        some information may be needed to register with us, to communicate with
        chatbots, or to take advantage of some of our features.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may stop using the Services at any time; however, your conversation
        logs from communications with chatbots may remain in our records.
      </p>
      <h2>What if I have questions about this policy?</h2>
      <p>
        If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies,
        please send us a detailed message to contact@blitz-bot.com and we will
        try to resolve your concerns.
